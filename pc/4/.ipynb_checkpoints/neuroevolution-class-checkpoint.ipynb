    "The fitness of the agent after 10 generations should not be very high. To improve the performance it would usually require quite a high number of generations. Use the following strategies to reduce the training time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reward shaping:** Instead of evaluating the agent until the end of the episode you can stop the evaluation after 500-700 steps and decrease the fitness by 100 if the agent has not landed (terminated is False) by that time. Alternatively you can subtract a penalty for every timestep. This would bias the search toward more aggressive landing strategies, which will also terminate faster.\n",
    "- **Incremental learning:** The fitness obtained averaging 5 episodes (initial conditions) is too noisy for the evolution to progress realiably, using about 20 episodes would make the fitness measurement much more reliable at the cost of substantially increasing the fitness computation time. A possible shortcut is use a fixed set of episodes for a number of generations. This can be done by passing a `seed` parameter (integer) to `env.reset` so that the fitness is evaluated over the same set of episodes across multiple generations. The episode counter could be used as the seed, potentially with some offset. In this way often 40-60 generations are usually sufficient to reach a reasonable fitness (100-200) on the training episodes. You can verify that the agent behaviour is good when tested using the seeds of the training episodes, but it can be significantly worse when the agent is tested using different seeds. Once the fitness has reached a basic flying competence on the training examples you can help the agent learn more general strategies by continuing training on either (i) different seeds, (ii) more episodes, or (iii) revert to random episodes. However there is a chance that the initial set of episodes would not be very representative of general cases and thus the evolution could overfit to a deep local minima and take a long time to recover when presented different episodes. This can also happen if the agent is trained for too long on the same episodes."
